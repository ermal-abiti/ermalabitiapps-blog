I am a software developer located in Kosovo, Mitrovica. I've been coding for more than 2 years in many programming languages. I have some experience in web development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), Python and Java.

I am currently studying **Computer Science and Engineering** at [UBT College](https://ubt-uni.net/) here in Kosovo.

All my personal coding projects are found in my [GitHub account](https://github.com/ermal-abiti). You can also find me in:
